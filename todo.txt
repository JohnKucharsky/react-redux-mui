- redux plan
    + look at template
    + copy basic structure from redux
    + add linter and packages
    + remove everything, copy after. step by step
    + make basic api slice separate, place in redux
    + api endpoints to all features
    + remove quotes, don't need it anymore
    - create table with checkboxes first, remove and edit later
    - try to separate test files
    - don't need axios, cypress?
    - start testing, look how it goes

- flat everything and make from scratch, don't use selectors
- after creating all in one file, make separate components
- try to use context, after that look at composition, if it's good, leave it
- look at mui data table, how it's implemented, think of optimization
- calling selectors with parameters
